## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-12

Initial public release on PyPI as `cli-agent-runner`.

### Added
- Three-layer model: Round / Loop / Witness.
- 13 CLI verbs: `init`, `install`, `uninstall`, `start`, `stop`, `kill`,
  `cancel`, `restart`, `status`, `round`, `serve`, `peek`, `watch`, `monitor`.
- 11 named defenses (round timeout, process group isolation, orphan stash
  with SHA lock, set-diff classification, smoke check, flock concurrency,
  atomic state writes, event kind registry, and others).
- 9 monitor detectors (`timeout_rate`, `hung`, `orphan_chain`,
  `disk_warning`, `disk_critical`, `mem_pressure`, `smoke_fail_rate`,
  `oauth_fail`, `network_fail`); `oauth_fail` and `disk_critical` auto-stop
  the service.
- Local-only and remote (via ssh) monitor modes.
- Auto-generated docs (`./build.sh docs`) for defenses table, detectors,
  events, config schema, CLI verbs.
- Literate quickstart: `docs/quickstart.md` is executed as a pytest test.
- Python public API (`from agent_runner import api`) mirroring CLI verbs.
- Phase 3 reservation: `[llm]` config section + `agent_runner.critic`
  Protocol stubs (no implementation).

### Documentation
- English README + full Chinese `README.zh.md`.
- 5 user-facing docs: quickstart, commands, configuration, runbook, architecture.

### Build & CI
- GitHub Actions matrix: Python 3.11/3.12/3.13 × ubuntu / macos.
- Codecov-uploaded coverage from one canonical matrix cell.
- Tag-triggered release with TestPyPI smoke stage before PyPI.
